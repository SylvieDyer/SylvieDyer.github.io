                <b>Nice to meet you, I'm Sylvie.</b>
                <br><br>
                I am currently an undergraduate studying at Case Western Reserve University. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. <br><br>
                I became interested in computer science while taking an intro to CS50 class in high school. Based on Harvard's CS50 course taught in C, I was introduced to the fundamentals of computer science and the aspects of problem solving that come with it.
                Immediately, I was hooked- I've always enjoyed solving puzzles and I discovered a new way to do so through code. As my endeavors in computer science have progressed, I've learned of all the ways it can be applied and how it can be used to create.<br><br>
                Since my first course in computer science, I've learned how to utilize C, Java, HTML, CSS, and R (along with exposure to Python, Django, and SQL), to program algorithms that solve problems, create websites (like this one!), and make fun games. <br><br>
                Outside of my school work, I enjoy photography, traveling, playing piano, and baking (specifically cookies). Whether it be helping a friend with their studies, or showing them how to utilize my favorite productivity software, notion,
                I always make time to help others. I hope to someday work for a company that prioritizes helping those in need, or works to fight the injustices in our modern society. I would love to be able to make a difference through my work and help others for the rest of my career. <br><br>
                
                I hope to use my skills in the future to become a successful Software Engineer by working with people who want to better the world! <br><br>
