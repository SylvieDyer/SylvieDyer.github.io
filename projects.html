    <div id="Tampi" class="tabContent">
        Tampi is an intersection between menstruation and IoT. By combining an iOS application, used to track a user's
        period cycle, and a RaspberryPi-powered lamp device (otherwise known as Lampi), Tampi works to destigmatize
        periods
        and encourage open discussions about menstruation.<br><br>

        Through the use of Lampi hardware and an iOS application, users will be able to visually track their, or a
        friends’,
        menstrual cycle through a color ke
        y. Additionally, users will be able to use the Lampi for casual application through preset and custom colors
        which
        can be controlled through either the iOS app or the Lampi’s Kivy touchscreen.
        <br><br>
        This project can be split into two main components: the iOS application and the lamp.<br>
        The iOS application is implemented using Swift, utilizing CoreData to store user data directly on the user's
        phone,
        to avoid the risk of any security breaches in an external database. This application communicates with Lampi via
        bluetooth. The lamp can be controlled through the app, or through the simple Kivy touchscreen interface.

    <div id="Musicle" class="tabContent">
        Musicle is a song-based guessing game, inspired by Wordle. <br><br>
        In this game, users will hear short snippets of a song that they will need to guess. Each incorrect guess will
        add a
        few more seconds to the snipped of the song. They will have 5 chances to guess the song before they lose.
        <br><br>
        This project was developed using React, storing song information in MongoDB, and utilizing the SoundCloudAPI to
        play
        music for the user.

    <div id="Quicode" class="tabContent">
        Quicode is an iOS application aimed to teach Computer Science principles to those who are looking to learn more.
        <br><br>
        Divided into bite-sized lessons, Quicode utilizes short, systematic, gamified questions to teach users.
        Targeted to those who don't have much time to devote towards learning how to code, or those who are beginning to
        learn Computer Science, Quicode is meant to make the process fun, quick, and simple.
        <br><br>
        Quicode is still under development.<br>
        It is served as an iOS application, developed in Swift. It utilizes CoreData to store user data, and S3 to store
        application-related data (questions, module information, etc.).

    <div id="Minesweeper" class="tabContent">
        This project is the classic Minesweeper game! <br>
        Allowing users to select a board size, this game allows users to play at any experience level and work their way
        up
        to the daunting 30x30 board ;)
